# Optimal-Routing-Problem
Bachelor Term Project
This repo contains my Bachelor Term Project related to find solution for optimal routing problem involving multiple servers and dispatchers. It is inspired from this research paper: [X. Fu and E. Modiano, "Optimal Routing to Parallel Servers With Unknown Utilitiesâ€”Multi-Armed Bandit With Queues," in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, vol. 31, no. 5, pp. 1997-2012, Oct. 2023, doi: 10.1109/TNET.2022.3227136.
